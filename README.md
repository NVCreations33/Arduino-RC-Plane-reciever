# Arduino-RC-Plane-reciever

This project features a lightweight, 9-channel Arduino-based RC receiver, optimized for use in RC planes. It includes the full Arduino code, a custom-designed PCB, Gerber files for manufacturing, schematic diagrams, and a realistic top-view image of the circuit.

> ⚙️ Designed to be compact and efficient — ideal for small, weight-sensitive RC aircraft.

## 🛠️ Customization

Want to adapt this receiver for a different RC platform?

- Modify a few lines of code (e.g., PWM mapping, motor output pins)
- Use the same PCB for:
  - 🚗 RC Cars
  - 🚤 RC Boats
  - 🤖 RC Robots

No need to redesign or rebuild the hardware!
